Additional considerations addendum 
HP Wireless Printers
To ensure optimal performance and security for HP wireless printers, it is recommended to place them on a dedicated print VLAN or IoT VLAN, such as VLAN 70. Appropriate firewall rules should be configured to allow essential services, including mDNS/Bonjour (UDP 5353) for AirPrint discovery, TCP ports 80, 161, and 8289 for HP JetDirect, SNMP, and other printing services, as well as UDP 427 for the Service Location Protocol.
Multicast forwarding is important for cross-VLAN printing. To enable this, activate Multicast Enhancement and the mDNS reflector on the UDM-SE. Additionally, assign static IP addresses to printers using DHCP reservation to provide consistent and reliable access.
Chromebook Optimization
For enhanced Chromebook connectivity, enable 802.11k/v/r features on U7 Pro XGS access points to support seamless WiFi roaming between classrooms. Activate band steering to direct Chromebooks to the 5 GHz and 6 GHz frequency bands, ensuring better network performance.
Quality of Service (QoS) rules should be configured to prioritize traffic for educational applications such as Google Meet, Google Classroom, and YouTube using DPI rules. For centralized device management, integrate with the Google Admin Console to enforce policies, manage updates, and control network access.
Additional Recommendations
Set up a student guest WiFi network with a captive portal to accommodate non-enrolled devices. Enable UniFi Insights to monitor the network in real time, providing visibility into device health and usage patterns. Schedule automated firmware updates during off-hours to maintain network security.
Implementing these steps will help ensure stable printing, reliable Chromebook connectivity, and scalable management across up to 350 devices.

A+UP Charter – Proactive Infrastructure Transformation Blueprint
Version 2.5: (Channel Spread, VoIP Jitter <30ms, mDNS Fallback, STP Alignment, Guest Throttle), November 10, 2025 Refinements
Executive Summary
This document presents an updated, nearly deployment-ready blueprint for the A+UP Campus infrastructure. These enhancements include WiFi channel planning with 80MHz separation, VoIP fine tuning, implementing mDNS fallback, and throttling guest bandwidth to 25/10 Mbps. The solution features 16 UAP-AC-PRO wireless access points (three additional units to address coverage voids), headroom for up to 30 VoIP devices, dedicated 2.4GHz wireless capacity and mDNS for printers, and flexible camera deployment. The network is designed to achieve 92–96% wireless coverage for 130–140 Chromebooks.
The total upfront investment is ~$3,880, with a potential resale offset of approximately $1,200.
Key Improvements (Project-Aligned)
WiFi Optimization: Deployment of 16 UAP-AC-PRO units, including three new access points (two upstairs in rooms 207 and 205/hallway, and one downstairs in room 117). The 5GHz band is prioritized, utilizing non-DFS channels (36, 52, 100, 116, 132, 149) with 80MHz separation, or 40MHz as fallback. The 2.4GHz band is globally disabled except for a low-power segment (WAP2/4) reserved for printers. The RSSI threshold is set to -70 dBm, with steering at a minimum of -67 dBm. Initial testing will involve five Chromebooks, with adjustments based on feedback from a Week 1 survey. The expected outcome is that 92–96% of devices will experience signal strength better than -65 dBm, with less than 3% drop rate.
Compliance & Resilience: The network will include deep packet inspection and filtering, support failover within five minutes, and utilize fiber for WAN demarcation.
EdTech Support: The infrastructure is designed to handle Google service bursts of up to 100 Mbps per room, ensuring adequate density.
Risk Mitigation: A Week 1 survey will identify any issues. Pre-shared key (PSK) and mDNS fallback (using Avahi/Bonjour if UniFi presents issues) are in place. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) for camera networks is aligned for compatibility.
Financial Summary
Upfront Investment: $3,814, including $2,120 for hardware, $99 for CyberSecure services, and $805 for labor and diagnostics. An estimated $1,000 can be recouped through hardware resale, but only if school lets us decommission.
Ongoing Costs: (if they are sold a service contract)$599 per month for Service-Only support, covering 10 hours of assistance.
Three-Year Savings: Projected at $34,452, largely due to reduced overages and fewer reactive service calls.
Core Infrastructure 
Gateway & Controller: UDM Pro Max with 10G capability, integrated IDS/IPS, UniFi OS, and fiber WAN via UF-SM-1G-S SFP (verified 1000BASE-LX 1310nm/10km).
Distribution: USW-Pro-Max-48-PoE switch, offering a 720W PoE budget and 10G uplink. Thirty-nine out of forty-eight ports are allocated, with TP-Link switches flexed for camera connections.
Wireless: Sixteen UAP-AC-PRO access points (including three additional units for coverage), with a Cloud Key Gen2 retained for management.
Endpoints: Approximately eight Yealink SIP-T43U phones on VLAN50, twelve to fifteen Verkada cameras on VLAN60 (model-specific PoE), and ad-hoc wireless printers on VLAN20.
Power: APC SMX2000LVNC UPS provides 8–12 minutes of runtime, maintaining PoE usage below 40% of baseline capacity.
Network Architecture
VLAN: Design & Capacity
Note: VLAN50 /27: 30 usable; DHCP 10.50.0.2–30. VLAN10: 4hr for transients. Printers: Ad-hoc 2.4GHz + mDNS reflector (UDM > Networks > Multicast DNS; fallback Avahi/Bonjour if AirPrint unreliable). MTU: 1500 consistent.  
Firewall Rules: Security Posture
PoE Power Budget & Future-Proofing  
Physical Topology Overview
The network topology has been confirmed with 39 out of 48 ports utilized, ensuring no overlap in assignments. The fiber handoff from Comcast uses an LC connector to the UDM SFP+ port (UF-SM-1G-S, $15; 1310nm validated). A 10G LACP uplink connects to the USW switch, with the following dedicated port allocations:
Access Points (APs): Ports 1–16 (16 ports)
VoIP Devices: Ports 17–24 (8 ports)
Cameras: Ports 25–39 (15 ports)
Spares: Ports 40–48 (9 open ports, including UPS on Port 48)
AP refinements include the deployment of 10 APs upstairs (adding channels 36, 52, and 100) and 6 APs downstairs (adding channels 116 and 132, with WAP13 relocated to Room 107). The 2.4GHz band is specifically carved for WAP2 and WAP4.
A contingency plan for the camera island involves trunking USW Port 40 to TP-Link Port 24. Ports 1–15 on TP-Link are assigned to ACCESS VLAN60 (PVID60) with PoE automatically or forcibly set depending on the model. Management IP is set to 10.60.0.250, with RSTP alignment using the 802.1w protocol. The line of demarcation (LoD) runs from Comcast to the demarcation point, and internal patching is handled from there. Optical power measurements should exceed -15 dBm.
Technical Enhancements
Chromebook Optimization: Enable 802.11k/v/r protocols; set -67 dBm as the steering minimum (testing with 5 units for sticky client behavior and adjusting the threshold to -70 dBm based on survey results). Implement DPI for Google traffic and maintain handoffs under 5 seconds.
VoIP: Use the G.722 codec with DSCP EF tagging, targeting jitter below 30ms and latency under 150ms. Disable ALG and ensure VLAN50 can scale to support 30 devices.
Verkada Cameras: Configure for 100 Kbps idle and 3 Mbps live streams (with potential bursts up to 45 Mbps). Set AF41 for priority and force PoE at the device for models CD52 and CD62.
Printers: Establish an ad-hoc VLAN20, carve the 2.4GHz band, and enable mDNS (UDM > Networks > Multicast DNS; fallback to Avahi/Bonjour for AirPrint compatibility). Inventory all printer models for 2.4GHz compatibility.
Guest Network (VLAN30): Implement a captive portal, bandwidth limits of 25 Mbps down/10 Mbps up, and maintain 90-day access logs.
Monitoring: Utilize UniFi Insights for monitoring PoE, VLAN, and WAN status; enable SNMP monitoring for UPS devices and track RSSI. The MTU is set to 1500.
Pre-Lab Go/No-Go Checklist
Blocking Tasks (By Nov 14): Validate Comcast handoff specifications (including optical and connector details); conduct Chrome 802.11k/v testing on 5 units; check SFP modules; prepare the lab bench; establish rollback procedures; update the Terri matrix; deploy 3 APs; confirm TP-Link stock and verify RSTP functionality.
Tasks Before Nov 17: Distribute PSK credentials; conduct mDNS lab tests (including AirPrint fallback); review Verkada camera models for PoE preferences; complete printer inventory for 2.4GHz and mDNS compatibility.

Technical Analysis for Future Network Engineering Reference – November 2025
1. Building Overview
Facility: 20,205 sq ft (approx. 10,000 sq ft per floor), renovated with Cat6 in 2021, featuring a central network closet.
Location: Urban Houston (highway edge, low ambient noise; 180–230 SSIDs detected per scan).
Existing Infrastructure: 13 × UAP-AC-PRO (WiFi 5, ceiling mounts; 7 upstairs, 6 downstairs), Cloud Key Gen2.
Device Density: 110–120 Chromebooks upstairs; 5-device cart downstairs.
Key Network Strains:
30–50% packet drops due to coverage gaps and roaming (5–10s disruptions)
2.4GHz: 70–80% channel saturation, 40–60% collision rates
5GHz: 30–40% airtime loss, 40–62 neighboring SSIDs per scan
Note: EdTech usage spikes (Google Meet, 100 Mbps/room) exacerbate existing coverage voids.
Survey Methodology: NetSpot (10+ data points per floor, SSID-tied screenshots). Note: Survey bias toward core areas; unsurveyed voids may result in 10–15% overstatement.
RF Model: RSSI model, n=3.5/4 (three-wall average, 5GHz, 20 dBm Tx, 100x80 ft grid): Mean RSSI -62 dBm upstairs / -57 dBm downstairs. Post-tuning: +6 dB improvement (75–82% → 90–95% coverage above -65 dBm).
2. Current Deployment & Proposed Hardware
Core Network: UDM Pro Max / USW-48-PoE ($1,673 + $260 optional adds).
Lab Pre-Tuning: Channel and power optimization; globally disable 2.4GHz; enable 802.11k/v/r; set RSSI threshold to -70 dBm.
Top-Line Coverage:
Upstairs: 82% (density constraints); projected 90% with two additional APs and rebalance
Downstairs: 85% (lean load); projected 93% with AP relocation
3. Second Floor – High-Density Core (~110 Chromebooks)
3.1. Load & Traffic Patterns
Classroom bursts: 15–30 devices per room, 100–200 Mbps/class (2018–2022 WiFi 5 fleet)
Library (Rm207): 20–30 simultaneous users
Hallways: 50+ concurrent roaming devices
3.2. Access Point Deployment Snapshot (7 APs)
Coverage Baseline: 75% above -65 dBm (core 85%, edges 55%); mean -62 dBm; 30% loss attributed to channel overlap and congestion.
3.3. Coverage Gaps & Overages
Rm207 Library (P1): No dedicated AP; -70 to -80 dBm (60 ft from WAP5/6, 3+ walls, unsurveyed); 20–30 Chromebooks, 40–50% drop rate.
Recommendation: Add WAP8 (ceiling center, channel 165 high, +15 dB to -55 dBm; aim for 100% reliability).
Rm205 (P2): -65 to -75 dBm (30–40 ft from WAP6, unsurveyed); lag for flex/storage cart.
Recommendation: Add WAP9 (door edge, channel 36 medium, +12 dB to -53 dBm) or relocate WAP9 from 1st-floor overlap.
Stairwells (P3): -70 to -82 dBm vertical; 5–10s drop risk.
Recommendation: Enable 802.11r/k/v and set RSSI threshold to -70 dBm; perform walk survey in Week 1.
Office (WAP2/4): Redundant -50 dBm (20 ft, 20% over-provision).
Recommendation: Lower WAP2 power, repurpose if feasible.
Survey Bias Note: Core-focused surveys may overstate coverage by 10%; unsurveyed voids present a 15% risk. Week 1 re-survey recommended.
3.4. RF & Channel Deployment
2.4GHz: 70–80% saturation (channels 1/6/11, 12–25 neighboring APs). Disable globally; configure WAP2 at low power for printers only.
5GHz: 30–40% airtime loss; channels 36/165 clean (4–8 neighbors), avoid 112/149 (10–15 neighbors). DFS channels (52/100) are acceptable (2–4 neighbors, 1–2% radar events).
Lab Tuning: Channels 36/165/157, 80MHz width. Simulated improvement: mean RSSI +7 dB (75% → 92% above -65 dBm); voids improve by +12–15 dB.
4. First Floor – Low-Density Secondary (~5 Chromebooks, Cart-Based)
4.1. Load & Traffic Patterns
Device cart roams, generating 20–50 Mbps bursts
Primary use: admin and storage; no high-density classrooms
4.2. Access Point Deployment Snapshot (6 APs)
Coverage Baseline: 78% above -65 dBm (core 85%, edges 60%); mean -57 dBm (upstairs +5 dB). 25% coverage loss from coverage stretches.
4.3. Coverage Gaps & Overages
Rm107 NW Corner (P1): -68 to -75 dBm (40–60 ft from WAP9/13, 3 walls, unsurveyed); cart/library faces 30% drop risk.
Recommendation: Relocate WAP13 (channel 36 high, +15 dB to -53 dBm; 85% reliability expected).
Rm117 NE Corner (P2): -65 to -72 dBm (40 ft from WAP11, obstructed, unsurveyed); lag risk for secondary use.
Recommendation: Increase WAP11 power (test for potential WAP12 channel clash) or relocate WAP9 (channel 149 medium, +12 dB).
Rm10 Central (P3): Notation may be obsolete; -43 to -58 dBm (WAP10).
Recommendation: Confirm status as of Nov 13 ("Rm10 complaints?"); disregard if storage.
Stairwells: Horizontal coverage fair (-55 to -65 dBm); vertical risk of 5s drops.
Recommendation: Enable 802.11r; conduct walk survey in Week 1.
Central (WAP10/13): Redundant -50 dBm (20–30 ft, 15% over-provision).
Recommendation: Relocate WAP13 to Rm107; set to low power prior to move.
Survey Bias Note: 80% of survey points are near APs; Rms 107/117 unsurveyed (10% coverage overstatement risk). Cart-based probing ("In 107/117?") recommended for pattern analysis.
4.4. RF & Channel Deployment
2.4GHz: 70–80% saturation (channels 1/6/11, 12–20 neighboring APs). Disable; carve out WAP8 for printers if necessary.
5GHz: 20–30% airtime loss; channels 36/165 clean (4–8 neighbors), avoid 112/149 (10–12 neighbors).
Lab Tuning: Channels 36/149/157, 80MHz width. Simulated improvement: mean RSSI +6 dB (78% → 94% coverage above -65 dBm); voids improve by +12–15 dB post-relocation.
AP ID | Location | Role | Issues (RSSI Est/Sim)
WAP1 | NW (Rm201 adj, 30° tilt) | Classrooms 201 | Fair (-65 dBm edges); tilt causes ~10% coverage loss.
WAP2 | Office (Rm208) | Admin | Redundant with WAP4 (-50 dBm); low-density inefficiency.
WAP3 | Rm201 | Classroom | Strong (-55 dBm); solid density support.
WAP4 | Office/Rm208 | Admin | Redundant with WAP2; signal bleed into Rm207 (-70 dBm).
WAP5 | Rm202 | Classroom | Strong (-58 dBm); 20+ Chromebooks supported well.
WAP6 | Rm206 | Classrooms 206/edge | Coverage stretched to Rms 205/207 (-68 dBm); lag risk present.

Project Dossier: IT Proposal – Unlimited Potential Charter School (A+UP)
Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive summary for the upcoming site visit on October 29. It aims to support the closure of the $699 per month UniFi-only Managed Service Provider (MSP) deal. This analysis is based on the project’s history, public records, and internal staff insights. Notably, there have been no recent social media mentions regarding IT issues at the school.
Project Overview
The project’s scope involves delivering a reliable WiFi and IT infrastructure for the 20,205 square foot campus located at 2410 Hamilton St, Houston, TX, which serves approximately 150 middle school students. The installation will include eight UniFi WiFi 6 Lite Access Points, two 16-port PoE+ switches, and a UniFi Dream Machine Router. The primary goals are to achieve at least 95% WiFi coverage, maintain 99% network uptime, and ensure compliance with CIPA and FERPA regulations. The handoff to the client will occur in phases over a 36-month period, with sole management through the UniFi Console.
An “Apples to Apples” offering looks something like $599 a month, Network backbone upgrade, 24/7 Remote monitoring, 10 hours a month emergency response with a 2 + (25m) response time, standard 9-5 desktop support (help desk tickets). This gives the better service, immediately fixes their problem and  strongly position them for future expansion.
Key timeline milestones include the site visit on October 29, second site survey, LOI and network overhaul installation and configuration. Terri is really interested in one on one training and phased shared access timeline. The strategy focuses on undercutting the current reactive vendor, empowering the client through a phased transition, and emphasizing regulatory compliance.
Key Players
Terrie Roberts: Business Operations Manager and main gatekeeper. She controls the budget and is described as tech-savvy based on her LinkedIn profile.
Kap McWhorter: Superintendent, responsible for strategic oversight and ensuring alignment with the school’s mission.
LaTrice Leonard: Principal, provides operational approval and places high value on network uptime.
Dwayne McCarty: Assistant Principal, whose focus is on assessments and regulatory compliance.
Kendall Benford-Ijeoma: Registrar, supports Terrie with Student Data (PEIMS) and may be involved in the handover training.
Kathy Welch: Board President, responsible for final budget approval.
Unnamed IT Manager: The specific role is unclear, but IT responsibilities are likely managed by Terrie or Kendall through the current MSP.
Situation Assessment
There are frequent WiFi dropouts and slow speeds, which disrupt both classroom instruction and administrative functions. The current vendor is considered expensive and reactive, with average monthly overages around $1,550. The school's infrastructure was renovated in 2021 and likely uses Cat6 or better cabling, with a central layout that may have some dead spots. The school manages around 150 devices and has limited internal IT resources.
The annual budget is approximately $1.6 million, with IT expenditures making up ~5–10%. Terrie manages vendor relationships, while the board must approve significant expenditures. Opportunities include aligning with the school's mission, demonstrating cost savings, showcasing UniFi’s self-management capabilities, and increasing buy-in through a gradual handover process.
Risks and Opportunities
Risks for the project include potential delays in access due to the IT Manager, MSP or board, infrastructure issues such as inadequate closet space rack space or cabling, gaps in compliance (legacy systems required for compliance), and the possibility of client churn if budget constraints become tighter.
Opportunities include upselling device management services for an additional cost per month, presenting clear sales pitch focusing on cost savings, and highlighting the potential $10,000 annual return on investment.
Action Plan and Gaps
Go over the sales pitch doc and proposal internally
Prepare a full UniFi demo for the site visit (maybe not possible on initial visit)
Better forecast tech support labor costs
Hardware acquisition timeline 
Site Survey
Customer expectations, any additional requirements for MSA draft
Inquire about the IT Manager’s role and current MSP situation during the visit
Current intelligence gaps include confirming the identity of the IT Manager (or determining if anyone local is involved) and ensuring access to network closets. Possible contingency, offer a complimentary audit report to continue building the relationship.
Our overall approach is to leverage Terrie’s known pain points and emphasize the cost savings and reliability offered by this proposal.

====================================================================================================

APC Rack SNMP + USB Monitoring Installation & Configuration Manual
For Network Engineers: SMX3000LVNC (Primary) and BVN650M1 (Secondary) via VLAN 99
Technical Overview
Objective: Enable SNMP monitoring on the primary UPS (SMX3000LVNC) and USB monitoring on the secondary UPS (BVN650M1) using VLAN 99 management network.
Estimated Time: 1.5–2.5 hours plus a 15-minute buffer for edge cases (e.g., firmware quirks).
Risks: SNMP string exposure (mitigated via VLAN 99 firewall and enforcing read-only access); halt procedure if Network Management Card (NMC) is absent.
Change Log Highlights:
Updated OIDs to PowerNet-MIB v4.2.1.
Primary model: SMX3000LVNC (3000VA/2700W).
Script uses AND-logic, stateful and robust parsing.
BVN USB monitoring via binary/Podman container.
Rack Baseline
Note: SMX runtime assumes 92% battery health (degraded from 18 min spec). Verify via NMC self-test (Menu → Test → Runtime Calibration).
Technical Specifications & Prerequisites
SNMP Requirements (Primary SMX3000LVNC)
Version: SNMPv2c (read-only; enforced by access type).
Key OIDs (PowerNet-MIB v4.2.1):
Battery Capacity (%): .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.1.2.2.1.0
Output Load (%): .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.1.4.2.3.0
Runtime Remaining (min): .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.1.2.2.3.0 (timeticks/6000)
Battery Status: .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.1.2.1.1.0
Traps: On-battery, low-battery (<20%), replace-battery
Bandwidth: <1 Kbps for polling; <10 Kbps for traps
USB Monitoring (Secondary BVN650M1)
Interface: USB (monitored via apcupsd on UDM; SNMP not supported)
Key Metrics: Battery %, load, runtime (polled via software)
Alerts: Low battery (<20%), runtime <5 min
Network & Hardware Settings
VLAN: 99 (Mgmt; SMX Static IP: 10.99.0.2/28 on port 48 GbE non-PoE; BVN USB direct to UDM)
UDM Integration: SNMP for SMX; apcupsd for BVN
Prerequisites:
Access to SMX NMC UI (via DHCP or scan; admin/physical password required)
apcupsd v3.14.14+ (manual binary or Podman container on UDM)
Browser, wget/tar, Podman, USB cable (<15 ft for BVN)
NMC Firmware: AOS 3.x+ for full SNMPv2c
Considerations: If UDM USB unreachable, fallback to BVN LCD; verify UDM USB compatibility with BVN pre-production (lsusb)
Installation & Configuration Procedure
Phase 1: Pre-Migration Preparation (45 min)
UPS Inventory Audit
Locate both UPS units in rack; note serial numbers and firmware (LCD: Menu > Status > About); verify model numbers.
Verify NMC presence on SMX (check rear panel for Ethernet port and LEDs). If absent, halt and order AP9631 NMC.
Record current IP address (likely DHCP); scan VLAN 99 or connect directly via laptop if needed.
Document UPS details in a "UPS Hero Sheet" (Google Sheets) using the following template:
UPS IDModelS/NIP/InterfaceMAC/USBVLAN PortCommunity/StringNotes
PrimarySMX3000LVNCABC12310.99.0.200:11..99-48mgmt_ro_202592% batt; ~16 min @1350W
SecondaryBVN650M1DEF456USB to UDMN/AUDM USBapcupsdAux <300W; 10-15 min
Physical Preparation
Label cables: SMX Ethernet (blue: "SMX-Mgmt → USW-48"); BVN USB (red: "BVN-Aux → UDM-USB"). Photograph rack for documentation.
Export SMX NMC configuration (UI: Config > Backup); snapshot BVN LCD.
Staged Validation Plan
Validate SMX NMC first, then BVN USB.
Success criteria: SNMP polling/traps on SMX; USB metrics on BVN (<5s response).
HALT if NMC is absent or access fails.
Phase 2: Primary UPS (SMX) SNMP Configuration (30 min)
Access & Basic Network Setup
Connect laptop to SMX NMC via Ethernet; identify IP via scan or LCD.
Access NMC UI: [URL] IP]; login with admin credentials.
Set static IP (10.99.0.2/28), gateway (10.99.0.1); apply changes and verify connectivity (ping UDM).
Enable SNMPv2c
Navigate: Config > Network > SNMPv1/v2c; enable SNMP v1/v2c.
Set community string ("mgmt_ro_2025"); enforce read-only access.
Add trap receiver (10.99.0.1:161); enable on-battery, low-battery, and replace-battery traps.
Apply and reboot NMC.
Verification
Run: snmpget -v2c -c mgmt_ro_2025 10.99.0.2 .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.1.2.2.1.0
Expected output: SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.318.1.1.1.2.2.1.0 = INTEGER: 92 (battery %)
If error: Check firewall/ping or verify OID/MIB version.
Phase 2B: Secondary UPS (BVN) USB Monitoring (15 min)
Step 2B.1: UDM Setup (USB Direct, Manual Binary)
Verify UDM USB compatibility (SSH: lsusb, expect "American Power Conversion").
Install apcupsd (choose one method)
Pre-compiled Binary (Recommended):
Download and extract: wget [URL], tar -xzf apcupsd-3.14.14-arm64.tar.gz
Copy binaries and config: cp apcupsd-3.14.14/sbin/apcupsd /usr/sbin/, cp apcupsd-3.14.14/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf /etc/apcupsd/
Set executable: chmod +x /usr/sbin/apcupsd
B. Podman Container (Stable):
Run container: podman run -d --name apcupsd --device=/dev/usb/hiddev0 -v /etc/apcupsd:/etc/apcupsd gersilex/apcupsd:latest
Enable restart on boot: podman generate systemd --new --name apcupsd > /etc/systemd/system/apcupsd.service; systemctl enable apcupsd.service
Alternatively, add to /config/scripts/post-boot.sh: podman start apcupsd
C. External Host (Fallback): Use Raspberry Pi on VLAN 99 (10.99.0.3); script via SSH poll.
Connect BVN USB and confirm detection.
Enable Monitoring
Edit /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf: UPSTYPE usb; DEVICE; ONBATTERYDELAY 6; BATTERYLEVEL 20; KILLDELAY 120 (default values otherwise).
Restart apcupsd: systemctl restart apcupsd (binary) or podman restart (container).
Check status: apcaccess status (shows batt/load/runtime).
Configure UDM notifications (e.g., email on battery capacity <20%).
Verification
Run apcaccess: Expect runtime ~10–15 min @180W.
If USB reach fails, fallback to BVN LCD (Menu > Status).
Phase 3: UniFi UDM Integration (15 min)
Enable SNMP on UDM (for SMX)
Console: Settings > CyberSecure > Traffic Logging > SNMP: Enable v2c; set community "mgmt_ro_2025".
Note: This enables UDM to respond to SNMP polls and to poll SMX using the configured community string.
Add Devices & Unified Alerts
Add SMX device: Devices > SNMP Add: 10.99.0.2.
Configure alerts:
Low Battery: OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.1.2.2.1.0 <20%
Critical Runtime: OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.1.2.2.3.0 <5 min (post-conversion)
Extend alerts to BVN via apcupsd integration.
Implement tandem monitoring script (polls every 5 min):
Save script, set executable, and add to crontab or post-boot scripts as appropriate.
AND logic ensures both UPS units are critical before shutdown.
Phase 4: Execution & Testing (30–60 min, Off-Hours)
Staged Enablement
Connect SMX to port 48; adopt and test SNMP polling/traps (LCD self-test).
Connect BVN USB to UDM; verify apcaccess; simulate low-battery (partial discharge, safe).
Full Validation
Simulate tandem outage by unplugging AC; monitor runtimes and alerts.
Trap Validation
Monitor UDM logs: tail -f /var/log/messages | grep TRAP
SMX LCD: Menu → Test → Simulate Power Failure (10 sec); verify trap received within 5 sec.
Cancel test via LCD to restore.
Baseline with Wireshark on VLAN 99 for SNMP traffic (filter: ip.src==10.99.0.2).
Rollback (If Needed)
Revert IPs and disconnect hardware if necessary.
Restore NMC backup; stop apcupsd; document configuration changes.
Testing & Validation Checklist
SMX SNMP: OID poll <5s; traps appear in Insights.
BVN USB: apcaccess reports runtime ~10–15 min; alerts trigger.
Tandem Script: Triggers warning if both runtimes <3 min; logs status variations.
VLAN 99: SMX is pingable; BVN detected via USB.
Runtime: SMX ~16 min @1350W; BVN ~10–15 min @180W.
Alerts: <20% battery triggers consolidated notifications.
Troubleshooting
SMX NMC Fail: Scan IP (DHCP?); reset; collect S/N, firmware, event log, network backup before escalation; verify with ping/snmpwalk.
BVN USB Silent: Check with lsusb; adjust configuration; fallback to LCD if unreachable.
OID Errors: Confirm MIB version; use snmpwalk; escalate to Ubiquiti if UDM poll fails.
Script Glitch: Check logs (/var/log/apcupsd, syslog); verify timeticks; escalate cron issues to UDM forum.
No NMC: Order AP9631; use LCD interim; escalate procurement if needed.
Known Limitations
BVN lacks SNMP: USB polling ~10s latency vs. SMX real-time; LCD fallback available.
SNMPv2c Security: Enforced RO via access type; VLAN 99 blocks external access—use ACLs for scaling.
Script Polling: 5-min interval; suitable for rack-level monitoring.
Post-Migration Optimization (Week 1)
Consolidate alerts on UDM dashboard; test notification chain (email/Slack).
Quarterly battery self-tests (LCD); replace if <80% health (SMX RBC132, BVN APCRBC124).
Security: Rotate SNMP community strings annually; audit VLAN ACLs.
Expansion: Port 46 available; consider SNMP-enabled PDUs if rack grows.
UPS | Model | VA/Watt | Battery Health | Runtime | Interface
Primary | SMX3000LVNC | 3000VA/2700W | 92% | ~16 min @1350W (half-load) | SNMP (NMC)
Secondary | BVN650M1 | 650VA/360W | N/A | ~10–15 min @180W | USB (apcupsd)

NTP Drift: Check UDP 123; confirm cloud/pool reachability
PoE Insufficient: Confirm 802.3at for IR models; injector temp test if >25W draw
Local Jitter/Frag: ICMP MTU allow; Wireshark RTSP filter; shorten Cat5e if flaps
Firmware Spike: Stagger updates (3/15min); temp QoS bump to CS6 (48)
STUN/WebRTC Issues: Verify UDP 3478; test live view in Command
8. Known Limitations
Cold Weather: at PoE required for heaters; monitor draw in winter
Local Only: TCP 554 LAN-bound; no cross-VLAN without explicit rules
DoH Unsupported: Use UDP 53; no encrypted DNS
9. Post-Migration Optimization (Week 2)
Rule Tune: 24h Wireshark; narrow 443 to specific Verkada endpoints as needed
Insights Setup: Command → Alerts → Bandwidth >2Mbps; PoE >80%

Yealink T43U VoIP Migration & Configuration Manual
From Spectrum Box to Direct SIP on UniFi USW-Pro-Max-48-PoE
Introduction
This manual provides a concise, lab-ready guide for migrating 8–12 Yealink T43U phones from a Spectrum-provided ATA/proxy (the "Spectrum box") to direct SIP registration on VLAN 50, utilizing UniFi UDM DHCP and USW-Pro-Max-48-PoE (ports 14–25). It preserves existing extensions, voicemail, and paging via the Spectrum cloud. The procedure is optimized for technical clarity, minimal downtime, and repeatable success.
Estimated Total Time: 4–6 hours (Lab: 2 hours; Production: 2–4 hours)
Risks: NAT traversal issues (ALG must be off), DHCP reservation glitches, RTP/codec mismatches
Lab Hero: Borrowed T43U for pre-production testing
Decommission: Remove Spectrum box only after successful lab validation
Technical Highlights & Change Log
RTP port range initially wide (10000–65535); narrow after Wireshark analysis (Post-Migration)
STUN tested only if NAT/one-way audio is present; static IPs preferred
Multicast paging limited to VLAN 50 unless IGMP routing is configured
G.722 codec prioritized (confirm with Spectrum); fallback to PCMU/PCMA
Wireshark RTP capture mandated in lab validation
Sections on limitations and optimization included for ongoing improvement
Phase 1: Pre-Migration Preparation (2 Hours)
Step 1.1: Extract Spectrum SIP Credentials
Objective: Obtain all required SIP registration details for direct phone provisioning.
Method A: Spectrum Portal (Preferred)
Log in to Spectrum Portal: https://business.spectrum.com/voice or https://voice.spectrum.com
Navigate: Settings → SIP Trunks → Account Details
Collect per line:
SIP Username (e.g., 7135551234@sip.spectrum.net)
SIP Password (12–16 chars)
SIP Server/Proxy
SIP Port (5060 UDP)
Outbound Proxy (if required)
STUN Server (ask Spectrum; test without first)
Export CSV if available (Settings → Extensions)
Confirm G.722 support with Spectrum
Method B: Spectrum Box UI (Fallback)
Access via IP: http://192.168.0.1 (see label)
Login: admin / [password from label]
Navigate: Voice → Line 1–4 → SIP Settings
Screenshot all credentials and server fields
Method C: From T43U Phone (Last Resort)
Menu → Settings → Advanced (pass: admin) → Accounts → SIP Server
Note: Passwords are obscured; portal preferred
Step 1.2: Inventory Phone Configuration
Objective: Document all phones and their current configurations for accurate reprovisioning.
Create a "VoIP Hero List" spreadsheet (Google Sheets/Excel):
Gather data per phone: Menu → Status → Network → IP; Status → Phone → MAC
Export from Spectrum Portal: Settings → Extensions
Prioritize 8 active phones for lab; document up to 12
Step 1.3: Lab-Test Direct SIP Registration
Objective: Validate direct SIP registration and core call features in a controlled environment.
Connect T43U to laptop via Ethernet (laptop acts as DHCP server, gateway 10.50.0.1/28; range 10.50.0.2–10.50.0.14)
Access T43U Web UI (http://10.50.0.10 or via DHCP lease); login as admin
Configure Account 1 with extracted SIP credentials (see Step 1.1)
Network: NAT Traversal set to STUN (test without first; enable if one-way audio)
Codec Priority: G.722 (if supported), fallback to PCMU/PCMA
Multicast Listening: 224.0.1.75, Label "All Staff", Codec G.711, Priority 1
Run Wireshark on laptop, filter for RTP during a test call; document RTP port range used
Test registration, extension-to-extension calls, voicemail access, and paging group
Check RTP jitter (<150ms under simulated load)
If any test fails, halt migration and escalate to Spectrum; otherwise, proceed to production
Phase 2: Switch & Network Configuration (1 Hour)
Step 2.1: Create Voice Port Profile
In UniFi Controller/UDM GUI: Settings → Profiles → Switch Port Profile → Create New
Profile Name: VoIP-Phones-VLAN50
VLAN: Native VLAN 50 (access port, untagged)
PoE: Mode Auto (802.3af/at); disable PoE+ (T43U needs only 7W)
Advanced:
Port Isolation: Disabled
Storm Control: Enabled (10% for paging)
Spanning Tree: Enabled, Edge Port
Link Aggregation: Disabled
Priority 5 (DSCP EF/46)
LLDP-MED: Enabled
Apply to USW-Pro-Max-48-PoE ports 14–25
Step 2.2: Verify LLDP-MED
Enable LLDP and LLDP-MED globally; set Voice VLAN 50, Priority 5
Verify in UniFi Controller: Devices → USW-Pro-Max-48-PoE → Ports → Port 14 → Insights → LLDP Tab
Expected: T43U detected, VLAN 50, Priority 5
CLI Alternative: show lldp neighbors (see port, MAC, VLAN)
Step 2.3: VLAN 50 Network Settings
Settings → Networks → Create New
Name: VoIP-Phones
VLAN ID: 50
Gateway/Subnet: 10.50.0.1/28
DHCP: Server; Range 10.50.0.2–10.50.0.14; Lease Time: Infinite
DNS: 10.50.0.1 (or 8.8.8.8)
Advanced: mDNS Disabled, IGMP Snooping Enabled, IPv6 Disabled
Step 2.4: DHCP Reservations
Settings → Networks → VoIP-Phones → DHCP → Fixed IP
Assign each T43U's MAC to a fixed IP (use spreadsheet from Step 1.2)
Verify via UDM Clients (filter by VLAN 50)
Phase 3: Firewall & QoS Configuration (1 Hour)
Step 3.1: Firewall Rules (VLAN 50 Traffic)
Step 3.2: Disable SIP ALG
On UDM CLI:
ssh admin@192.168.1.1
configure
set system conntrack modules sip disable
commit; save
exit
# Verify: show system conntrack modules (should show sip: disabled)
Step 3.3: QoS Configuration
Settings → Internet → WAN Networks → Primary → Smart Queues: Enable (Download/Upload: 420 Mbps)
Create Traffic Rule:
Name: VoIP-Priority
Protocol: UDP
Source: VLAN 50
Destination: Internet
Ports: 5060–5061, 10000–65535
DSCP: EF (46)
Rate Limit: None (unlimited for voice)
Phase 4: Migration Execution (2–4 Hours, Off-Hours)
Step 4.1: Bulk Provisioning via TFTP (Recommended for 12 Phones)
Install TFTP server (e.g., tftpd64 for Windows) on UDM or laptop
Create global template (y000000000000.cfg) with standardized SIP and network settings
Create MAC-specific config files (e.g., 805ec0abcd01.cfg) with unique credentials
Set DHCP Option 66 to tftp://10.50.0.1
On phones: Menu → Settings → Auto Provision → Server URL (or via DHCP auto-provision)
Step 4.2: Manual Provisioning (For <8 Phones)
Connect T43U to USW ports 14–25 (VLAN 50, PoE auto)
Access Web UI (http://10.50.0.x) and configure with SIP credentials from Step 1.1
Set Network → VLAN ID = 50
Enable STUN only if required (test for one-way audio)
Set Codec: Preferred G.722, secondary PCMU/PCMA
Configure Multicast: 224.0.1.75, Label "All Staff", Codec G.711 (0)
Save and reboot phone
Step 4.3: Testing & Validation
Test extension-to-extension calls
Test voicemail access (*98)
Test paging group broadcast
Under simulated load, confirm RTP jitter <150ms (Wireshark: "sip || rtp || rtcp")
Step 4.4: Decommission Spectrum Box
If all tests pass: Power off and store Spectrum box as fallback (optionally resell)
If failures: Retain box and troubleshoot; escalate to Spectrum support as needed
Testing & Validation Checklist
[ ] SIP registration: "Registered" displayed
[ ] Extension call: Connects, no one-way audio
[ ] Voicemail retrieval: <10s
[ ] Paging group broadcast: No jitter (<150ms)
[ ] DHCP reservation: IP consistent after reboot
[ ] LLDP-MED: Phone auto-discovers VLAN 50
Troubleshooting
Registration Fails: Verify SIP credentials, disable SIP ALG, capture with Wireshark
One-Way Audio: NAT issue—test STUN/outbound proxy; confirm settings
No PoE: Confirm port profile, check USW PoE status
Paging Drops: Ensure IGMP snooping/storm control enabled, paging on VLAN 50 only
Known Limitations
RTP Port Range: Wide by default (10000–65535); narrow after Week 2 Wireshark analysis
Multicast Paging: VLAN 50 only; cross-VLAN requires IGMP routing
Codec Support: G.722 prioritized; confirm support with Spectrum before deployment
Post-Migration Optimization (Week 2)
Narrow RTP Firewall Rules:
Capture 24 hours of RTP traffic (Wireshark), identify active port range
Update firewall and QoS rules accordingly
Verify Codec Usage:
Check phone status (Menu → Status → Codec)
If G.722 is not active, reprioritize to PCMU
Optimize Multicast Paging:
Test paging to multiple groups
If cross-VLAN paging needed, enable IGMP routing on UDM
This manual is your technical playbook—test thoroughly in the lab, then execute the migration with confidence. For 12 phones, choose bulk (TFTP) for speed or manual for granular control.
