**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: November 10, 2025  
**Decision Maker**: Travis Rylander (Network Architect)  
**Scope**: Wireless coverage, roaming, band optimization

## Context

A+UP's existing WiFi deployment uses basic AP placement with manual band steering:

**Current State**:
- 13 APs (TRENDnet/Netgear, older models without 802.11k/v/r)
- Manual channel assignment (VERY susceptible to interference)
- No band steering (devices stick to 2.4 GHz even when 5 GHz available)
- ~5 Mbps effective throughput per Chromebook in classrooms
- Student WiFi drop rate: 55% during day (class transitions, hallway roaming)
- Weak coverage in bathrooms and portable classrooms

**Lab Validation** (Nov 8-9, 2025):
- Deployed 3 UAP-AC-PRO units with recommended channels + RSSI tuning
- Measured +6 dBm average RSSI improvement (better coverage depth)
- Student drop rate reduced to <3% (5% improvement within same footprint)
- Throughput per student increased to 12-15 Mbps (2.5-3x improvement)

## Decision

**Upgrade to 16× UAP-AC-PRO with 802.11k/v/r fast roaming, six-channel 80MHz spread, and RSSI-based band steering**.

| Parameter | Standard | Target |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Total APs** | 13 (mixed) | 16 (uniform UAP-AC-PRO) |
| **5GHz Channels** | 36-165 (36/40/44/48/52/56/60/64/100/...) | 36, 52, 100, 116, 132, 149 (6 channels, 80MHz, non-DFS primary) |
| **2.4GHz** | Enabled globally | Disabled globally (except WAP2/4 carve for printers) |
| **Band Steering** | Manual | Automatic RSSI-based (-67 dBm minimum) |
| **Roaming** | Manual (5-15 sec) | 802.11k/v/r fast roaming (<5 sec) |
| **Coverage Goal** | 92% above -67 dBm | 96% above -65 dBm (lab-validated) |

## Rationale

### Why 802.11k/v/r?

**802.11k (Neighbor Reports)**:
- Allows APs to advertise nearby APs' channel/RSSI to clients
- Client can optimize roaming decision (no blind handoff)
- Reduces "WiFi searching" time when walking between classrooms
- **Benefit for K-12**: Students can move hallways without dropping calls

**802.11v (BSS Transition Management)**:
- AP can suggest client transition to stronger AP before signal degrades
- Proactive handoff (no wait for -70 dBm threshold)
- Eliminates brief disconnection during roaming
- **Benefit for K-12**: Chromebook video playback stays uninterrupted during class transitions

**802.11r (Fast Roaming)**:
- FT (Fast Transition) key pre-derivation
- Roaming <5 sec (vs. 5-15 sec with standard reassociation)
- **Benefit for K-12**: Satisfactory for video calls and real-time learning apps

### Why Six 80MHz Channels (Non-DFS)?

**Channels Selected**: 36, 52, 100, 116, 132, 149

| Channel | Frequency | DFS | Reason | AP Count |
|---------|-----------|-----|--------|----------|
| 36 | 5.15-5.25 GHz | ❌ No | Stable, never requires DFS | 2-3 APs |
| 52 | 5.25-5.35 GHz | ⚠️ Yes (UNII-2) | DFS can cause 30-min lock-out (school event risk) | 2-3 APs |
| 100 | 5.47-5.725 GHz | ⚠️ Yes (UNII-3) | Secondary (avoid if possible, but needed for 10-AP coverage) | 2-3 APs |
| 116 | 5.725-5.850 GHz | ⚠️ Yes (UNII-3) | Downstairs APs only (separate from upstairs 36/52/100) | 2-3 APs |
| 132 | 5.850-5.925 GHz | ⚠️ Yes (UNII-3) | Downstairs secondary (rare interference) | 1-2 APs |
| 149 | 5.850-5.925 GHz | ❌ No | ISM band (overlaps with 132 but no DFS) | 1-2 APs |

**Non-DFS Primary Channels** (36, 149):
- DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) requires 30-min radar scan before use
- If radar detected, AP must switch channels (during school event = disaster)
- Solution: Use non-DFS channels (36, 149) as primaries; DFS channels as secondaries only

### Why Disable 2.4GHz Globally?

**Current Problem**:
- 2.4GHz enabled on all APs → clients default to 2.4 GHz (weaker signal = easier)
- 40 printers broadcast mDNS on 2.4 GHz
- Chromebooks maintain 2.4 GHz connection even near 5GHz AP
- Result: 10 Mbps throughput (2.4 GHz limit) instead of 50+ (5GHz potential)

**Solution** (WiFi Assessment V2.1 recommendation):
- Disable 2.4GHz globally on all APs
- Except: Create single low-power 2.4GHz "WAP2/4" dedicated to printers (VLAN 20 only)
- Result: Students forced to 5GHz (band steering works)

**WAP2/4 Carve (Special AP for Printers)**:
- 1 Low-power 2.4GHz AP in central location (break room, staff area)
- SSID: "Printer-Setup-2.4" (VLAN 20 only)
- Tx power: -10 dBm (50 mW, ~25 feet range)
- Disabled 5GHz radio on this AP (dedicates to 2.4GHz only)
- mDNS reflector runs on UDM → forwards printer discovery from 2.4GHz AP to VLAN 20
- **Result**: Printers discoverable in AirPrint, Chromebooks stay on 5GHz

### Why RSSI -67 dBm Steering Threshold?

**Signal Strength Math** (from WiFi Assessment):

| RSSI | Quality | Throughput | Use Case |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **-50 dBm** | Excellent | 50+ Mbps | Close to AP, perfect conditions |
| **-60 dBm** | Good | 30-40 Mbps | Normal classroom, solid connection |
| **-67 dBm** | Fair | 15-20 Mbps | Edge of classroom, hallway |
| **-70 dBm** | Poor | 5-10 Mbps | Far hallway, weak connection |
| **-80 dBm** | Very Poor | <5 Mbps | Almost disconnected |

**Threshold Decision** (-67 dBm):
- ✅ Lab testing showed -67 dBm still provides 15+ Mbps (acceptable for YouTube, Google Classroom)
- ✅ Roaming at -67 dBm catches students before classroom edge zones
- ✅ Prevents lingering on weak AP after class moves
- ✅ Matches best practice for education deployments (WiFi Alliance recommendation)
